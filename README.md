"WeatherApp" is a user-friendly `React application` designed to provide real-time weather updates for any city in the world. The application leverages `WeatherAPI` to fetch current weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and overall conditions. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can easily check the weather in their desired location. This project showcases my skills in `React development`, API integration, and responsive design.
